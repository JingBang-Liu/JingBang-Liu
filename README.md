- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JingBang-Liu, a postdoc at University of Oslo.
- :closed_book: Previously I was a PhD student at Warwick University exploring fluid at nanoscale.
- ðŸ‘€ Particularly I'm interested in developing theory and playing around numerical simulations to model nano thinfilm and study its dynamics (breakup, moving contat line, etc.).
- ðŸŒ± I'm able to code in Fortran 90, Matlab and Python. Iâ€™m currently learning Julia, maybe C++ in the future.
- ðŸ“« Here is my email: jingbanl@math.uio.no. You can also find my websit here: https://jingbang-liu.github.io.
