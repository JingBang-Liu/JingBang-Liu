- 👋 Hi, I’m @JingBang-Liu, a 4th year PhD student at Warwick University exploring fluid at nanoscale.
- 👀 Particularly I'm interested in developing theory and playing around numerical simulations to model nano thinfilm and study its dynamics (breakup, moving contat line, etc.).
- 🌱 I'm able to code in Fortran 90, Matlab and Python. I’m currently learning Julia, maybe C++ in the future.
- 📫 Here is my email: jingbang.liu@warwick.ac.uk
